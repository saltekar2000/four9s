# four9s
For each integer from 0 to 100, this program finds a way of forming the integer from four 9s using just the operations +, -, /, *, ^ (power), sqrt(), decimal point, () brackets, and ! (factorial).  The output is presented in reverse polish notation (RPN, think of old HP calculators). This is done to avoid having to deal with brackets.
